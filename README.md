**Rectangle_summ_matrix.** A rectangular matrix is supplied to the program as a set of strings. The program outputs a matrix of the same size, in which each element at position [i, j] is equal to the sum of the elements of the first matrix at positions [i-1, j], [i + 1, j], [i, j-1], [i, j + 1]. For extreme characters, the adjacent element is located on the opposite side of the matrix. In the case of one row/column, the element itself is a neighbor in the corresponding direction.
